# TuneMyPets
This is a small introductive projet that aims at showing how to build and using fine-tuning/transfer learning approaches for image recognition.

In this example, we show how to build a AI model based on the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) architecture for image recognition, and how we can enhance its accuracy by using fine-tuning and transfer learning approaches.

## Prerequisites

### Anaconda

To execute the code, we will set up a specific environment using Anaconda. To install it, visit [Anaconda Installation](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/).

### Setup conda environment

First, create the conda environment:
```
conda create -n TuneMyPets python=3.8
```

Then, activate the conda environment:
```
conda activate TuneMyPets
```

Once the environment is properly created, install the necessary Python libraries to execute the code:
```
cconda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch
```
```
pip install pillow
```
